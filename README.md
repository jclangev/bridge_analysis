# bridge analysis
The goal is to be able to analyse my bridge results by
1. scrape boards and results from our clubs website at bridge.nl
2. use the double dummy API to get the optimal result of the board
3. analyse which boards can be improved upon and how
  - better bidding (too high, too low, wrong denomination, competition or not)
  - better defending (lead, other)
  - better declarer play (lead impact, other)
